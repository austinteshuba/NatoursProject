These are just some notes for myself about the course

Basic Design Principles:

1) Fluid Grids and Layouts

To allow content to adapt to different screen sizes (i.e. viewport widths), we should use percentages rather than pixels

There are 3 major ways of laying out a website:

1) Float based layouts: Putting boxes next to each other using floats. Most supported by alternatives
    This is what is used in this Natours project.
2) FlexBox: Great for laying out elements in a 1D Row. Doesn't work with all browsers
3) Grid: Great for laying out elements in a 2D Grid. Doesn't work with all browsers

2) Flexible/Responsive Images

Images need to be adapted for each viewport widths. They aren't like text, where this can be handled nicely with code.

3) Media Queries

To change styles depending on specific ranges of viewport width (usually for mobile and desktop)
We use media queries to create a different version of our site for different widths.
