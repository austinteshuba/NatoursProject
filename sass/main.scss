/*
Firstly, this is a lot of comments.
This is because the below is acting
as my NOTES for SASS and CSS.
As such, things are way over explained.

Also, the directory is intended for large projects.
This is super overkill for a small project like this one,
but it's always good to start with a solid architecture
you can build on easily. Based on 7:1 Principle.
